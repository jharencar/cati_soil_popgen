## Data

We collected soil samples from six different patches of *Calochotrus tiburonensis* on Ring Mountain. The number of soil samples collected from each patch depended on the patch size, ranging from 1-6 samples per patch. We sampled the nearest plant to each soil core for genetic analysis. ((In two cases, two side-by-side plants were collected)).
